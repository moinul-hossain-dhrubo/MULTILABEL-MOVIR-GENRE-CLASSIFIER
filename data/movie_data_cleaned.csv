After having been dragged into the woods, she was sexually assaulted by three men, all of whom are known to the family. Ranjit and his wife go to the police, and the men are arrested. But the family's relief is short-lived when the villagers and their leaders launch a sustained campaign to force Ranjit to drop the charges. They demand the girl marry one of her rapists-a tried and true community solution. This, they feel, is the only way to restore her honour and that of the community. Ranjit defies their edict and embarks on a perilous journey, navigating both the labyrinth of India's courts and the rising dangers in his village. A cinematic, story-driven documentary, To Kill a Tiger follows Ranjit's uphill battle to find justice for his child. In India, where a rape is reported every 20 minutes and conviction rates are less than 30 percent, Ranjit's decision to support his daughter is virtually unheard of, and his journey unprecedented. His stand piques the interest of the Srijan Foundation, an NGO working to sensitize men and boys on women's rights. They look to Ranjit as a poster boy for their work and an inspiration to other men. Their support, along with the presence of the camera crew, fuels the ire of the villagers, and as the trial gets underway, threats of violence begin to loom. Ostracized by the community, dealing with mounting debt and fearing for himself and his family, Ranjit's composure begins to crack, and the whole process is in danger of being derailed. With tremendous access to all facets of the story, To Kill a Tiger charts the emotional journey of an ordinary man facing extraordinary circumstances.
